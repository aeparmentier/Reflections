How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I did this excercise on windows using command prompt and the FC command.

Being able to view changes allowed me to quickly pinpoint errors because it
filtered out all the unchanged text and showed just the pertinant parts. While
it would be possible to break something outside the scope of the changes. A
funcion for instance. As a first check, the things that are changed are the most
likely place for an error as simple typos are all it takes to break a program.
