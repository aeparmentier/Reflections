When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository has a few benefits
1. keeping a backup of your work. If a local machine crashes your code and version history still exists.
2. allows you to work on code from multiple locations and keep them synced
3. allows many people to collaborate on projects & see and use the full version history
